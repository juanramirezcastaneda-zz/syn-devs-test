# syn-devs-test

A test solution for syn dev

Solution created using the angular-cli tool

To run this project one must install dependencies using npm i and afterwards run the ng serve command

I hard a difficult time implementing the ng effect, i thought this was the most important feature, so i lack of the time needed to create the pagination and the corresponding test for the algorith.
